Inbox ProtonMail theme
======================

**New**: this repository is not maintained anymore, the themes are now available in [ProtonMail theme creator](http://scastiel.gitlab.io/protonmail-theme-creator/), where you can also customize the colors to create your own theme.

A light and clear theme for ProtonMail, inspired by Google Inbox, with several color styles.

To install it, copy the whole CSS in *dist/pm-inbox-xxxxx-theme.css* (replace xxxxx with the style you choose, see below), open your ProtonMail account settings, select the *Appearance* tab, and paste the CSS into the *Custom theme* field.

This is based on [Austin Delamar's work](https://github.com/amdelamar/pm-theme).

Several styles are provided, feel free to create (and submit me by pull request) your own!
